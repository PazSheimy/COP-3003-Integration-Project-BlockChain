# COP-3003-Integration-Project-BlockChain

# Requirements and files where they are meet.

LO1. Design and implement a class.                                                                                                 -> in User.h file

LO4. Include a comment in which you compare and contrast the procedural/functional approach and the object-oriented approach       -> in UserInfo.h file

LO1a. At least one class in a header file with non-trivial methods implemented in a cpp file                                       -> in User.h file

LO1b. Overload a constructor                                                                                                       -> in User.h file

LO1c. Utilize an initialization list                                                                                               -> in user.h file

LO2. Use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.                      -> in userInfo.h file

LO2a. Include comments describing the visibility inheritance model                                                                 -> in userInfo.h file

LO3. Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch.                                                      -> in userInfo.cpp file

LO5. Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype).                                                                                                                        -> in userInfo.h file

LO6. Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.                                          -> in userInfo.h file

LO7. Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as arguments.           -> in TransactionData.h file

Include class diagrams for all classes in Readme
